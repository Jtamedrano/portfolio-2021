          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Born and raised in Southern California, I have been developing for
            the web since 2019. Straight out of highschool, I started a career
            in sales. I have over five years of sales and customer service
            interaction experience, and two of those five years in a management
            role.

            My passion for Software Development began in this period where I
            wanted to automate the sales process. Most of the tools I found we
            either hard to use or required a monthly subscription. Instead, I
            decided to make tools that would help me reach my goal of automating
            the sales process for myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, I am a software developer and some of my favorite projects have
            be Software as a Service (SaaS) type of applications from Messaging
            Applications to Customer Relationship Management System (still
            working this).
